# GitHub Classroom Setup Guide

This repository is designed to work as a GitHub Classroom assignment template for the DNA barcoding lab (ENTM201L Week 8).

## For Instructors

### Setting Up the Assignment

1. **Create Assignment in GitHub Classroom**
   - Go to your GitHub Classroom dashboard
   - Click "New Assignment"
   - Select this repository as the template
   - Assignment name: "Week 8 - DNA Barcoding Analysis"

2. **Configure Assignment Settings**
   - Enable: "Grant students admin access to their repository"
   - Deadline: Set according to your course schedule
   - Grading: Enable auto-grading with the provided workflow

3. **Auto-Grading Workflow**
   - The `.github/workflows/autograding.yml` checks for completion
   - Verifies both tutorial and analysis results exist
   - Does NOT check scientific correctness
   - Passes if all required output files are present

4. **Generate Assignment Link**
   - Copy the invitation link
   - Share with students via Canvas/email

### What Auto-Grading Checks

#### Tutorial Completion
Required files in `results/tutorial/`:
- `01_qc/qc_report.html`
- `02_consensus/consensus_report.html`
- `03_alignment/aligned_sequences.fasta`
- `04_phylogeny/tree.treefile`
- `05_blast/identification_report.html`

#### Student Analysis Completion
Required files in `results/my_analysis/`:
- `01_qc/qc_report.html`
- `02_consensus/consensus_sequences.fasta`
- `04_phylogeny/tree.png`
- `05_blast/identification_report.html`

### What Instructors Should Manually Grade

The auto-grading only checks workflow completion. You should review:

1. **Species Identification Accuracy**
   - Check BLAST results in `05_blast/identification_report.html`
   - Verify % identity scores are reasonable (>95%)
   - Confirm species matches are biologically plausible

2. **Phylogenetic Tree Interpretation**
   - Review `04_phylogeny/tree.png`
   - Check if student samples cluster with expected species
   - Verify bootstrap values show confidence

3. **Assignment Responses**
   - Review answers in `assignment.md`
   - Check understanding of QC, consensus, phylogeny concepts

4. **Quality Control Understanding**
   - Check `01_qc/qc_report.html`
   - Verify students understand pass/fail criteria
   - Confirm they can interpret quality scores

## For Students

### How to Submit Your Assignment

1. **Accept the Assignment**
   - Click the GitHub Classroom invitation link
   - Accept the assignment to create your private repository
   - Clone your repository to your computer

2. **Complete the Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Tutorial (required)
   ./tutorial.sh

   # Step 2: Analyze your data
   ./run-analysis.sh

   # Step 3: Fill out assignment.md
   ```

3. **Commit and Push Your Results**
   ```bash
   git add results/ assignment.md
   git commit -m "Complete DNA barcoding analysis"
   git push
   ```

4. **Verify Auto-Grading Passed**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Actions" tab
   - Check that the "Auto-Grading" workflow passed ✅
   - If failed, review the error messages and complete missing steps

### Troubleshooting

**Auto-grading failed with "Tutorial not completed"**
- Run `./tutorial.sh` and let it complete all 5 steps
- Commit the `results/tutorial/` directory
- Push to GitHub

**Auto-grading failed with "Analysis not completed"**
- Run `./run-analysis.sh` with your .ab1 files
- Commit the `results/my_analysis/` directory
- Push to GitHub

**"Results directory not found"**
- Make sure you committed the results/ folder
- Check .gitignore is not blocking results/

## Technical Details

### Repository Structure for Students

```
dna-barcoding-analysis/
├── data/
│   ├── student_sequences/    # PUT YOUR .ab1 FILES HERE
│   ├── test_data/             # Tutorial data (included)
│   └── reference_sequences/   # 52 mosquito references (included)
├── results/                   # COMMIT THIS FOR AUTO-GRADING
│   ├── tutorial/              # Generated by tutorial.sh
│   └── my_analysis/           # Generated by run-analysis.sh
├── tutorial.sh                # Step 1: Learn the workflow
├── run-analysis.sh            # Step 2: Analyze your data
└── assignment.md              # Step 3: Fill this out
```

### Workflow Triggers

The auto-grading workflow runs:
- On push to main branch (when results/ files change)
- On pull requests
- Manually via "Actions" tab → "Run workflow"

### Privacy and Academic Integrity

- Student repositories are PRIVATE (only student + instructors can access)
- Each student gets their own fork of the template
- Students cannot see other students' repositories
- All commits are timestamped for academic integrity
