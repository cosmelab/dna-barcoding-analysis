# HMW DNA Cleanup Protocol (Isopropanol + NaOAc)

Use this protocol to remove organic contaminants (salts, EDTA, phenol) that cause low 260/230 ratios.

---

## Input Materials

- 50 µL DNA sample
- 3 M Sodium Acetate, pH 5.2
- Isopropanol (100%)
- 70% Ethanol (fresh)
- 1.5-2 mL low-bind microcentrifuge tube

---

## Protocol

### Step 1: Add Sodium Acetate

Add **5 µL of 3 M NaOAc** (final ~0.3 M).

Mix by **slow inversion** (10-12 times). Do NOT vortex.

---

### Step 2: Add Isopropanol

Add **35-40 µL isopropanol** (0.7-0.8x volume).

Mix by gentle inversion (10-12 times).

**Incubate**: 10-20 min at RT or on ice.

---

### Step 3: Pellet the DNA

**Spin**: 3000-5000 x g for 5-10 minutes

> Keep g-force low to protect HMW DNA integrity

Pellet will appear as a soft smear on tube side or bottom.

### Step 4: Wash with 70% Ethanol

1. Carefully decant supernatant
2. Add **500-1000 µL of 70% ethanol**
3. Gently invert 3-4 times
4. Spin 2-3 min at same g-force
5. Remove ethanol completely
6. **Repeat** for a second wash

---

### Step 5: Dry Pellet

Air-dry for **5-10 minutes**.

Pellet should look matte, not cracked.

---

### Step 6: Resuspend DNA

Add **50-100 µL of 10 mM Tris pH 8**.

Let dissolve:
- 1-2 hours at RT, or
- Overnight at 4°C

Mix by gentle flicking only.

---

### Step 7: QC

Measure by:
- **Qubit** (concentration)
- **NanoDrop** (260/230 should improve)

Optional:
- Run on gel or TapeStation to confirm HMW integrity

## Expected Improvement

| Metric | Before Cleanup | After Cleanup |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| 260/230 | < 1.0 (poor) | > 2.0 (good) |
| 260/280 | variable | 1.8-2.0 |
| DNA loss | - | ~10-20% |

---

## When to Use This Protocol

- 260/230 ratio < 2.0 (organic contamination)
- PCR inhibition suspected
- Before sending samples for sequencing
- When NanoDrop shows "dirty" samples

## Tips

1. **Fresh 70% ethanol** is critical - old ethanol absorbs water
2. **Low-bind tubes** prevent DNA sticking to plastic
3. **Don't over-dry** - makes resuspension difficult
4. **Be patient** with resuspension - HMW DNA dissolves slowly
5. **Never vortex** HMW DNA - causes shearing
