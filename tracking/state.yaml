blocking_issues:
  - 'Investigate if tree visualization is missing one of 4 consensus samples'
  - 'Fix tutorial vs tutorials directory confusion'
  - 'Results directories need linear numbering (01_qc, 02_consensus, etc)'
  - 'Need getting started ASCII protocol for students'
target_ready_date: '2025-11-19'
lab_context: Week 8 - Sanger sequencing analysis (students will analyze their PCR products from UC genomics)
strategy: '5-step consensus workflow, interactive tutorial required, reference sequences for tree context, zero-coding-experience friendly'
completed_today:
  - Created consensus sequence module (modules/01b_consensus/)
  - Added --pairs-only flag to only use complete F+R pairs
  - Updated workflow to 5 steps (QC → Consensus → Combine+Refs → Align+Tree → BLAST)
  - Tested complete pipeline on 30 student .ab1 files
  - Created interactive tutorial script (tutorial.sh)
  - Updated ASSIGNMENT.md with new workflow
  - Updated docs/pipeline_workflow.md with visual guide
  - Added decision D014 for consensus workflow
  - Multi-arch container working (docker.io/cosmelab/dna-barcoding-analysis:latest)
current_status:
  - 5-step consensus workflow tested and working
  - Student data results (30 .ab1 files, 15 samples)
  - QC passed 12/30 sequences, 4 samples with complete F+R pairs
  - Tree includes 4 student samples + 52 reference mosquitoes (56 total)
  - Species identified (1 Aedes albopictus, 3 Culex pipiens, all >98% identity)
  - Tutorial script ready for students (uses test_data, 15-20 min)
  - Assignment updated with clear instructions and grading rubric
next_up:
  - Investigate tree visualization (check if all 4 samples visible in PNG)
  - Rename results dirs with linear numbering (01_qc, 02_consensus, 03_alignment, 04_phylogeny, 05_blast)
  - Create scripts/ directory and move tutorial.sh there
  - Fix tutorial vs tutorials confusion (consolidate to one approach)
  - Create ASCII getting started guide (git clone → docker setup → tutorial → analysis)
  - Document docker workflow (Docker Desktop running, docker login, pull container)
  - Test tutorial.sh end-to-end
  - Verify Windows compatibility
