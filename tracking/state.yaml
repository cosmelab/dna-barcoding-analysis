lab_context: Week 8 - Sanger sequencing analysis (students will analyze their PCR products from UC genomics)
strategy: 'Minimal container (<800MB), automated scripts for non-coders, single GitHub
  Classroom assignment, simple HTML output, Hoque et al 2022 reference data'
completed_today:
  - Repository reorganization (data/, tutorials/, container/, modules/)
  - Fixed ALL CAPS filename violations (only README.md caps)
  - QC report now groups F/R pairs together
  - Added visual alignment viewer (conserved=UPPERCASE, variable=lowercase, color-coded)
  - Fixed Dockerfile build context (root instead of container/)
  - Created initial website landing page (docs/index.html)
  - Removed empty directories
  - Enabled multi-architecture container builds (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64)
current_status:
  - Multi-arch container building in GitHub Actions (commit 12f7ebf)
  - All bioconda packages verified for arm64 compatibility
  - Repository structure clean and linear
  - Ready for pipeline testing once build completes
next_up:
  - Wait for container build to complete
  - Test full pipeline: QC → alignment → tree → BLAST with data/test_data
  - Review all created modules and scripts
  - Determine best linear workflow for students
  - Create comprehensive website with tutorial HTML pages
  - Configure GitHub Classroom assignment
