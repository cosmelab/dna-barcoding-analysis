lab_context: Week 8 - Sanger sequencing analysis (students will analyze their PCR products from UC genomics)
strategy: '5-step consensus workflow, interactive tutorial required, reference sequences for tree context, zero-coding-experience friendly'
completed_today:
  - Created modules/02_consensus/README.md (comprehensive docs)
  - Fixed CRLF line endings in scripts (/bin/bash^M error)
  - Tested run-analysis.sh end-to-end (all 5 steps, 30 .ab1 files)
  - Tested tutorial.sh (test data, numbered dirs working)
  - Verified tree visualization (all 4 samples present)
  - Confirmed numbered directory structure works
  - All blocking issues resolved
  - Updated tracking/decisions.yaml with D015-D018 (interactive prompts, GitHub Classroom, public release, website)
  - Added interactive prompts with 5-second timeout to both scripts (D015)
  - Updated README.md with prerequisites section and website note
  - Created GitHub Actions auto-grading workflow (.github/workflows/autograding.yml)
  - Created github_classroom.md setup guide (instructor + student sections)
  - Updated .gitignore to allow results/ for auto-grading
  - Committed test results and verified workflow triggers
  - Pushed all changes to GitHub main branch
current_status:
  - Repository template READY for GitHub Classroom
  - Auto-grading workflow deployed and functional
  - All scripts tested with interactive prompts
  - Documentation complete (README, github_classroom, start_here)
  - Container publicly accessible (cosmelab/dna-barcoding-analysis:latest)
  - No sensitive information in repository
  - Naming conventions followed (only README.md in caps)
  - 5-step workflow fully tested and working
  - AWAITING: GitHub Classroom assignment creation by instructor
pending_decisions:
  - Keep or hide tracking/ directory before public release
  - Create LICENSE file (README mentions MIT + CC BY 4.0)
  - Remove student .ab1 files from data/student_sequences/
next_up:
  - Instructor creates GitHub Classroom assignment via web interface
  - Generate invitation link for students
  - Optional: Beta test with one student before full class rollout
  - Optional: Create documentation website (D018)
  - Optional: Test on Windows platform
