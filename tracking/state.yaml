lab_context: Week 8 - Sanger sequencing analysis (students will analyze their PCR products from UC genomics)
strategy: '5-step consensus workflow, interactive tutorial required, reference sequences for tree context, zero-coding-experience friendly'
completed_today:
  - Created modules/02_consensus/README.md (comprehensive docs)
  - Fixed CRLF line endings in scripts (/bin/bash^M error)
  - Tested run-analysis.sh end-to-end (all 5 steps, 30 .ab1 files)
  - Tested tutorial.sh (test data, numbered dirs working)
  - Verified tree visualization (all 4 samples present)
  - Confirmed numbered directory structure works
  - All blocking issues resolved
  - Updated tracking/decisions.yaml with D015-D018 (interactive prompts, GitHub Classroom, public release, website)
current_status:
  - 5-step consensus workflow tested and working
  - Student data results (30 .ab1 files, 15 samples)
  - QC passed 12/30 sequences, 4 samples with complete F+R pairs
  - Tree includes 4 student samples + 52 reference mosquitoes (56 total)
  - Species identified (1 Aedes albopictus, 3 Culex pipiens, all >98% identity)
  - Tutorial script ready for students (uses test_data, 15-20 min)
  - Assignment updated with clear instructions and grading rubric
  - Repository ready for public release after polish
next_up:
  - Add interactive prompts with timeout to tutorial.sh and run-analysis.sh (D015)
  - Update README.md with prerequisites and platform-specific setup instructions
  - Review all documentation for professional tone and moderate emoji usage (D017)
  - Create GitHub Actions workflow for auto-grading (D016)
  - Setup GitHub Classroom assignment from template repo (D016)
  - Create documentation website similar to entm201l-fall2025 (D018)
  - Test complete workflow on Windows (optional, low priority)
