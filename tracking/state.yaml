lab_context: Week 8 - Sanger sequencing analysis (students will analyze their PCR products from UC genomics)
strategy: '5-step consensus workflow, interactive tutorial required, reference sequences for tree context, zero-coding-experience friendly'
completed_today:
  - Created modules/02_consensus/README.md (comprehensive docs)
  - Fixed CRLF line endings in scripts (/bin/bash^M error)
  - Tested run-analysis.sh end-to-end (all 5 steps, 30 .ab1 files)
  - Tested tutorial.sh (test data, numbered dirs working)
  - Verified tree visualization (all 4 samples present)
  - Confirmed numbered directory structure works
  - All blocking issues resolved
current_status:
  - 5-step consensus workflow tested and working
  - Student data results (30 .ab1 files, 15 samples)
  - QC passed 12/30 sequences, 4 samples with complete F+R pairs
  - Tree includes 4 student samples + 52 reference mosquitoes (56 total)
  - Species identified (1 Aedes albopictus, 3 Culex pipiens, all >98% identity)
  - Tutorial script ready for students (uses test_data, 15-20 min)
  - Assignment updated with clear instructions and grading rubric
next_up:
  - Create modules/02_consensus/README.md (explain F+R pairing, --pairs-only)
  - Test run-analysis.sh with data/student_sequences/ (30 .ab1 files)
  - Test tutorial.sh with data/test_data/ (verify numbered dirs work)
  - Investigate tree PNG (verify all 4 consensus samples visible)
  - Optional: archive modules/00_assembly/ and master_pipeline.py (legacy code)
  - Optional: verify Windows compatibility
