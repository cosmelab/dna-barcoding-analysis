lab_context: Week 8 - Sanger sequencing analysis (students will analyze their PCR products from UC genomics)
strategy: '5-step consensus workflow, interactive tutorial required, reference sequences for tree context, zero-coding-experience friendly'
completed_today:
  - Fixed phylogenetic tree color-coding bug (whitespace issue in Bio.Phylo labels)
  - Student samples now display in RED, references in TEAL
  - Regenerated trees for both tutorial and my_analysis
  - Updated iqtree_guide.md with Maximum Likelihood explanation
  - Researched modern tree visualization libraries (pyCirclize, ETE3, iTOL)
  - Identified opportunity to improve tree aesthetics and layouts
current_status:
  - Repository template READY for GitHub Classroom
  - Auto-grading workflow deployed and functional
  - All scripts tested with interactive prompts
  - Documentation complete (README, github_classroom, start_here)
  - Container publicly accessible (cosmelab/dna-barcoding-analysis:latest)
  - No sensitive information in repository
  - Naming conventions followed (only README.md in caps)
  - 5-step workflow fully tested and working
  - AWAITING: GitHub Classroom assignment creation by instructor
pending_decisions:
  - Keep or hide tracking/ directory before public release
  - Create LICENSE file (README mentions MIT + CC BY 4.0)
  - Remove student .ab1 files from data/student_sequences/
next_up:
  - ACTIVE: Explore modern tree visualization options (circular, radial layouts)
  - ACTIVE: Test pyCirclize, ETE3, or Plotly for better tree aesthetics
  - ACTIVE: Implement name abbreviation system with full-name table
  - Consider: Multiple tree layout options for students to choose from
  - Optional: Create documentation website (D018)
  - Optional: Test on Windows platform
  - Ready: GitHub Classroom assignment creation by instructor
