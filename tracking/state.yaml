lab_context: Week 8 - Sanger sequencing analysis (students will analyze their PCR products from UC genomics)
strategy: '5-step consensus workflow, interactive tutorial required, reference sequences for tree context, zero-coding-experience friendly'
completed_today:
  - Enhanced HTML reports with beautiful colorful design
  - Embedded CSS in all HTML reports for reliable loading
  - Improved consensus creation using BioPython pairwise alignment
  - Fixed low identity issue (27% -> 94.8% with proper alignment)
  - Added sequence alignment visualization with match/mismatch indicators
  - Implemented collapsible sections for detailed sequence views
  - Added 80bp block formatting for sequences
  - Created comprehensive instructions in consensus report
  - Updated QC report to embed CSS like consensus
  - Verified Hoque et al 2022 COI amplicon size (~712bp)
  - Improved consensus merging strategy for overlapping reads
current_status:
  - Repository template READY for GitHub Classroom
  - Auto-grading workflow deployed and functional
  - All scripts tested with interactive prompts
  - Documentation complete (README, github_classroom, start_here)
  - Container publicly accessible (cosmelab/dna-barcoding-analysis:latest)
  - No sensitive information in repository
  - Naming conventions followed (only README.md in caps)
  - 5-step workflow fully tested and working
  - AWAITING: GitHub Classroom assignment creation by instructor
pending_decisions:
  - Keep or hide tracking/ directory before public release
  - Create LICENSE file (README mentions MIT + CC BY 4.0)
  - Remove student .ab1 files from data/student_sequences/
next_up:
  - Instructor creates GitHub Classroom assignment via web interface
  - Generate invitation link for students
  - Optional: Beta test with one student before full class rollout
  - Optional: Create documentation website (D018)
  - Optional: Test on Windows platform
