lab_context: Week 8 - Sanger sequencing analysis (students will analyze their PCR products from UC genomics)
strategy: 'Minimal container (<800MB), automated scripts for non-coders, single GitHub
  Classroom assignment, simple HTML output, Hoque et al 2022 reference data'
completed_today:
  - Repository reorganization (data/, tutorials/, container/, modules/)
  - Fixed ALL CAPS filename violations (only README.md caps)
  - QC report now groups F/R pairs together
  - Added visual alignment viewer (conserved=UPPERCASE, variable=lowercase, color-coded)
  - Fixed Dockerfile build context (root instead of container/)
  - Created initial website landing page (docs/index.html)
  - Removed empty directories
  - Enabled multi-architecture container builds (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64)
  - Successfully built and deployed multi-arch container (4.53GB)
  - Tested all 4 analysis modules with real chromatogram data
  - Fixed BLAST HTML report CSS bug
current_status:
  - Multi-arch container tested and working (arm64 on Mac)
  - ALL MODULES TESTED SUCCESSFULLY with data/test_data
  - QC: 4/8 sequences passed (AT99 F+R, AT_ROCK F+R)
  - Alignment: 4 sequences, 785bp alignment with visual viewer
  - Phylogeny: IQ-TREE built tree successfully
  - BLAST: Identified Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti
next_up:
  - Review all created modules and scripts for code quality
  - Determine best linear workflow for students
  - Create comprehensive website with tutorial HTML pages
  - Configure GitHub Classroom assignment
  - Test full automated analyze-sequences pipeline
