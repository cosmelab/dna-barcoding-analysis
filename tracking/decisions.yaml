  question: Which tools should be included in the Docker container for CLI pathway?
  decision: 'Tracy CLI (basecalling, alignment, deconvolution), MAFFT (sequence alignment),
    IQ-TREE2 (phylogenetic inference), ClipKIT (alignment trimming)'
  rationale: These are current 2025 gold standard tools verified by web search. All
    open-source and actively maintained.

  question: Should we support both GUI and CLI pathways?
  decision: 'YES - Dual pathway approach. GUI: Tracy web + UGENE/SeaView (no Docker).
    CLI: Docker container with all tools for reproducibility.'
  rationale: Students have varying comfort levels with terminal. GUI pathway for beginners,
    CLI for reproducible science.

  question: What base image should the Dockerfile use?
  decision: 'Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as base. Install tools via: (1) Tracy - download
    binary from GitHub releases, (2) MAFFT - apt-get, (3) IQ-TREE2 - download binary,
    (4) ClipKIT - pip install.'
  rationale: Ubuntu LTS provides stability, widely used in bioinformatics. Mix of package
    manager and direct downloads for latest versions.

  question: What additional infrastructure is available for this project?
  decision: 'Perplexity API available for literature review and citation verification.
    API key configured in shell profiles (local + HPC). Can query for latest methods,
    validate protocols, find references.'
  rationale: Need to document available research tools for protocol development and
    literature integration

  question: Tool versions verified for 2025?
  decision: 'YES - All tools verified current: Tracy (updated Mar 2025, GitHub: gear-genomics/tracy),
    MAFFT (stable, widely used), IQ-TREE2 (current standard for phylogenetics), ClipKIT
    (active development). Alternative GUI: Jalview, AliView for alignment visualization.'
  rationale: WebSearch verification on 2025-11-17 confirmed all tools are actively
    maintained and current best practices

  question: What should be the container strategy after reviewing RNA-seq setup?
  decision: 'Use mambaorg/micromamba:1.5.0 as base (not Ubuntu). Minimal install: BioPython,
    MAFFT, IQTree2, BLAST, R (ape/ggtree). Copy terminal setup from RNA-seq (zsh +
    oh-my-zsh + Dracula + colorls + lsd + starship). Target size: <800MB.'
  rationale: RNA-seq container demonstrates excellent minimal design. Students love
    the beautiful terminal. Micromamba faster than apt-get for bioinformatics tools.

  question: Which reference sequences should we use?
  decision: 'Use Hoque et al 2022 mosquito COI sequences (85 sequences from 19 species,
    6 genera). GenBank accessions in Tables 2-3. AUCOS primers have 67.5% success
    vs 16.7% for Folmer. Create Python script to fetch from GenBank + optional Zenodo
    dataset.'
  rationale: Paper provides validated mosquito COI data with improved primers. Multiple
    genera for diversity. All sequences publicly available in GenBank.

  question: Should we remove Tracy from the container?
  decision: 'YES - Keep BioPython for .ab1 parsing instead. Tracy is for basecalling
    from raw data; students will have pre-processed chromatograms. BioPython lighter
    and sufficient for QC.'
  rationale: Students receive chromatograms from sequencing facility, not raw data.
    BioPython can parse .ab1 files and extract quality scores for QC. Keeps container
    minimal.

  question: How should alignment visualization work?
  decision: 'Create interactive HTML visualization based on Hoque Fig 1. Large letters
    = conserved positions, small letters = variable positions. Color-code by nucleotide.
    Use plotly for interactivity. Students will love this visual representation of
    variation.'
  rationale: Visual learners benefit from seeing where variation occurs. Hoque Fig
    1 is excellent example. Interactive HTML allows zooming and exploration.

  question: What output format for results?
  decision: 'HTML dashboard (not PDF). Tabs: QC Report, Alignment View, Phylogenetic
    Tree, Species Identification. Interactive plots with plotly. Single index.html
    file students can open in browser.'
  rationale: Students have no coding experience - browser-based dashboard is familiar.
    Interactive plots more engaging than static PDFs. Easy to share and view.

  question: Should we support both GUI and CLI pathways?
  decision: 'NO - CLI only with Docker. BUT make it so simple it feels like GUI. One
    command: analyze-sequences. Beautiful terminal makes it approachable. GitHub Classroom
    with docker-compose.yml for easy start.'
  rationale: Maintaining two pathways doubles work. Docker ensures reproducibility.
    Beautiful terminal + automation scripts make CLI accessible. Students use one
    command and get HTML dashboard - feels like GUI.
