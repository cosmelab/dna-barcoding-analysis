  question: Which tools should be included in the Docker container for CLI pathway?
  decision: 'Tracy CLI (basecalling, alignment, deconvolution), MAFFT (sequence alignment),
    IQ-TREE2 (phylogenetic inference), ClipKIT (alignment trimming)'
  rationale: These are current 2025 gold standard tools verified by web search. All
    open-source and actively maintained.

  question: Should we support both GUI and CLI pathways?
  decision: 'YES - Dual pathway approach. GUI: Tracy web + UGENE/SeaView (no Docker).
    CLI: Docker container with all tools for reproducibility.'
  rationale: Students have varying comfort levels with terminal. GUI pathway for beginners,
    CLI for reproducible science.

  question: What base image should the Dockerfile use?
  decision: 'Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as base. Install tools via: (1) Tracy - download
    binary from GitHub releases, (2) MAFFT - apt-get, (3) IQ-TREE2 - download binary,
    (4) ClipKIT - pip install.'
  rationale: Ubuntu LTS provides stability, widely used in bioinformatics. Mix of package
    manager and direct downloads for latest versions.

  question: What additional infrastructure is available for this project?
  decision: 'Perplexity API available for literature review and citation verification.
    API key configured in shell profiles (local + HPC). Can query for latest methods,
    validate protocols, find references.'
  rationale: Need to document available research tools for protocol development and
    literature integration

  question: Tool versions verified for 2025?
  decision: 'YES - All tools verified current: Tracy (updated Mar 2025, GitHub: gear-genomics/tracy),
    MAFFT (stable, widely used), IQ-TREE2 (current standard for phylogenetics), ClipKIT
    (active development). Alternative GUI: Jalview, AliView for alignment visualization.'
  rationale: WebSearch verification on 2025-11-17 confirmed all tools are actively
    maintained and current best practices

  question: What should be the container strategy after reviewing RNA-seq setup?
  decision: 'Use mambaorg/micromamba:1.5.0 as base (not Ubuntu). Minimal install: BioPython,
    MAFFT, IQTree2, BLAST, R (ape/ggtree). Copy terminal setup from RNA-seq (zsh +
    oh-my-zsh + Dracula + colorls + lsd + starship). Target size: <800MB.'
  rationale: RNA-seq container demonstrates excellent minimal design. Students love
    the beautiful terminal. Micromamba faster than apt-get for bioinformatics tools.

  question: Which reference sequences should we use?
  decision: 'Use Hoque et al 2022 mosquito COI sequences (85 sequences from 19 species,
    6 genera). GenBank accessions in Tables 2-3. AUCOS primers have 67.5% success
    vs 16.7% for Folmer. Create Python script to fetch from GenBank + optional Zenodo
    dataset.'
  rationale: Paper provides validated mosquito COI data with improved primers. Multiple
    genera for diversity. All sequences publicly available in GenBank.

  question: Should we remove Tracy from the container?
  decision: 'YES - Keep BioPython for .ab1 parsing instead. Tracy is for basecalling
    from raw data; students will have pre-processed chromatograms. BioPython lighter
    and sufficient for QC.'
  rationale: Students receive chromatograms from sequencing facility, not raw data.
    BioPython can parse .ab1 files and extract quality scores for QC. Keeps container
    minimal.

  question: How should alignment visualization work?
  decision: 'Create interactive HTML visualization based on Hoque Fig 1. Large letters
    = conserved positions, small letters = variable positions. Color-code by nucleotide.
    Use plotly for interactivity. Students will love this visual representation of
    variation.'
  rationale: Visual learners benefit from seeing where variation occurs. Hoque Fig
    1 is excellent example. Interactive HTML allows zooming and exploration.

  question: What output format for results?
  decision: 'HTML dashboard (not PDF). Tabs: QC Report, Alignment View, Phylogenetic
    Tree, Species Identification. Interactive plots with plotly. Single index.html
    file students can open in browser.'
  rationale: Students have no coding experience - browser-based dashboard is familiar.
    Interactive plots more engaging than static PDFs. Easy to share and view.

  question: Should we support both GUI and CLI pathways?
  decision: 'NO - CLI only with Docker. BUT make it so simple it feels like GUI. One
    command: analyze-sequences. Beautiful terminal makes it approachable. GitHub Classroom
    with docker-compose.yml for easy start.'
  rationale: Maintaining two pathways doubles work. Docker ensures reproducibility.
    Beautiful terminal + automation scripts make CLI accessible. Students use one
    command and get HTML dashboard - feels like GUI.

  question: Should containers ever be built locally on Mac?
  decision: 'ABSOLUTELY NOT. NEVER build Linux containers on Mac. ONLY use GitHub Actions
    for builds. Container available at ghcr.io/cosmelab/dna-barcoding-analysis:latest
    and docker.io/cosmelab/dna-barcoding-analysis:latest. Pull only, never build.'
  rationale: 'Building Linux containers on Mac causes platform issues. GitHub Actions
    builds for correct platform (linux/amd64). Students and developers MUST pull
    pre-built images.'

  question: Should we build multi-architecture containers to support Apple Silicon Macs?
  decision: 'YES - Build for both linux/amd64 and linux/arm64. All required packages
    verified available: bioconda packages (mafft, iqtree, blast) and lsd-rs binaries
    exist for both architectures. Docker automatically pulls correct architecture.'
  rationale: 'Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3) are arm64 architecture. Building native
    arm64 images eliminates emulation overhead. All dependencies confirmed available
    for linux-aarch64. No performance penalty, better user experience.'

  question: Should we create consensus sequences from F+R pairs and only use samples with complete pairs?
  decision: 'YES - Implement 5-step workflow: (1) QC on all .ab1 files, (2) Create consensus from F+R pairs with --pairs-only flag, (3) Combine consensus with 52 reference sequences, (4) Align and build tree with all 56 sequences, (5) BLAST only the consensus sequences for species ID.'
  rationale: 'Consensus sequences from forward and reverse reads are more accurate than single reads. Combining with reference sequences in the tree allows students to see where their samples cluster with known SoCal mosquito species. Only using complete F+R pairs ensures high quality data for species identification. This matches best practices in DNA barcoding (Hoque et al 2022).'

  question: Should scripts have interactive prompts to open HTML reports?
  decision: 'YES - Add "Press ENTER to open report" prompts with timeout fallback. If student does not press ENTER within a few seconds, script auto-continues without opening. Makes it interactive but does not block automation or testing.'
  rationale: 'Students benefit from interactive experience ("Press ENTER..."), but automated testing and CI/CD require non-blocking execution. Timeout ensures best of both worlds: engagement for students, automation for developers.'

  question: How should GitHub Classroom be integrated for this assignment?
  decision: 'Create assignment from template repo. Students get private forks. Use GitHub Actions to verify completion: (1) Check that tutorial.sh results exist in results/tutorial/, (2) Check that run-analysis.sh results exist in results/my_analysis/, (3) Verify required output files (QC report, tree, BLAST results). Auto-grading checks completion, not correctness.'
  rationale: 'GitHub Classroom provides private student repos with auto-grading. We want to verify students completed the workflow, not grade their mosquito species identification (that is biology, not bioinformatics). Actions can check for presence of result files.'

  question: Should repository be polished before public release?
  decision: 'YES - Review all documentation for professional tone, moderate emoji usage (keep student-friendly but not excessive), remove any sensitive information, ensure consistent formatting. Create comprehensive documentation website similar to entm201l-fall2025 site.'
  rationale: 'Repository will be public GitHub Classroom template. Must be professional, well-documented, and accessible to beginners. Website provides better UX than GitHub markdown for students.'

  rationale: 'Website provides better navigation and visual presentation than GitHub README. Students can bookmark and reference throughout lab. Matches existing course infrastructure and branding.'
