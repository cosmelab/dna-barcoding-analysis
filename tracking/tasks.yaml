  notes: 'User discovered README paths were wrong (consensus/ vs 02_consensus/). Fixed all paths but need to test complete workflow: Step 1 QC → Step 2 Consensus → Step 3 Combine → Step 4 Alignment → Step 5 BLAST. Ensure all commands work and output files are created in correct locations. This prevents students from hitting errors when following README.'
